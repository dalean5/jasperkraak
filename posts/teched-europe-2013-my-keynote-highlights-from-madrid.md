Although TechEd North America finished some three weeks ago I would like to mention a couple things from the, mostly the same Keynote as 3 weeks yonder. They have not become less worthwhile in that short period of time.

And, there was a great announcement! The bits of a lot of upcoming stuff are available as of today as Preview:

- Server 2012 R2
- System Center 2012 R2
- SQL 2014
- Visual Studio

Here comes the summer <span style="font-family:Wingdings">J</span>.

As an IT Pro I focus on what was said concerning this line of IT Business. A quote I really liked: “BYO is not a privilege, it is a right.” Such is the perception of users. Out of that Identity Management is a major thing and Microsoft proposes to leverage Azure Active Directory with the Onprem Active Directory (no-brainer for Office365 en Intune admins). The same goes for leveraging Windows Intune with SCCM! SQL 2014 Management Studio can connect to SQL Azure

Extending stuff to Azure with the Windows Azure Pack, gives the look and feel of the Azure Portal to both your Private Cloud and the Azure Public Cloud. The MSDN accounts on Azure are now calculated per minute (as per hour in the “old” days), making it easier for Devs to test their Apps.

A super Server 2012 R2 feature is “auto-tiering” of storage where you can mix SSD with JOBD and the OS will find out what to store where, now that is cool!

Azure now has a Hyper-V Recovery Service with which you van Orchestrate Data Center failovers….. pffff.

A demo of Windows 8.1 showed us “workplace connect” en “worker folders”. I like the Wrker Folders (on Server 2012 R2 that is); it syncs and secures ordinary fileshares over hhtps to any user-device…. Very very neat!

The rest of my 1<sup>st</sup> day was filled with assisting as Microsoft Certified Trainer so no details from me on the breakout sessions which you can see on [http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Europe/2013?wt.mc\_id=homepagetop#fbid=CJ-2jXdm1ag](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Europe/2013?wt.mc_id=homepagetop#fbid=CJ-2jXdm1ag)

Enjoy, I’ll be back with more!
