People who know me, know that one of my slogans is “Who needs an Operating System”. Through some mysterious pathway I am currently taking some Operating System exams…. (MD-100 = Windows Client, AZ-800 and AZ-801 = Windows Server) Huh??

Organizations and their way of thinking IT only move so fast (actually real slow). Clinging to the Desktop, be it physical or virtual, and clinging to Servers, be it on-prem or in the Cloud. While the technology to rid of that ancient stuff has been out there for a while now. Who would need a full Desktop OS if all Applications were Web Apps? Why deploy IaaS solutions while PaaS and SaaS solutions are real?

So anyway, apparently, we live in a Hybrid IT world, in this context meaning that we are mixing and mingling traditional deployments with all the Cloud goodies. Which does not make it easier to use these goodies. And there pops up my reason to take another round (#8) at Microsoft Operating systems Certifications. To oblige as Trainer, Consultant and Advisor. Reality sucks , doesn’t it?

Happy Learning!
