A couple of weeks ago I already blogged about the 2 new Microsoft Exams on Cloud. There’s nothing new about Microsoft introducing new exams and new exam tracks.

And yet, there is something really different going on now. Most of the Microsoft exams are about servers, their installation, configuration and management.

Well “Server Huggers”, I have bad news for you! We’re done with servers, it’s all about Services! Those of you who already took the Office365 (beta) Exams know what I’m talking about.

For the MCT-Community that is going to be tough as well. A lot of my fellow (senior) consultants are still thinking “servers” and are having a hard time in shifting that towards “services”. And as senior consultants are having a hard time in making that shift, imagine what that means for Systems Engineers, the people we train.

So, are you up to it? Are you able to let go of your servers? Because you have to “walk the talk”, don’t you. You cannot preach services while clinging on to your servers. There is loads of stuff out there to train yourself in shifting from servers to services:

– Office365

– Windows Intune

– Azure

– System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2012

– System Center 2012 as a whole (that is a lot of food….)

If you haven’t begun already you should start right now! I’m talking about your future, no kidding. The other day I attended a seminar at Microsoft about the Microsoft Datacenters. The speaker was very, very clear: the server huggers will be the first people to lose their jobs in the next 3 to 7 years.

Get Ready!
