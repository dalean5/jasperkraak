After 48 hours of playing with Windows8 I found some interesting things when using Office365 Services.

**Exchange**

Windows8 comes with a Mail client. For my company Qwise, we have set up Active Directory Federation Services. But when connecting with the Windows8 Mail client, you just put in your mailaddress and your password and your ready to go. Apparantly the redirection to the Federation Server occurs in the background. That’s neat!

And you can have multiple accounts in there as well; I use Office365 for both my workmail as for my private mail. As in Outlook 2010, I can connect to more than one Exchange Server! Cool!

Here’s what the mail client looks like:

**Sharepoint**

When connecting to SharePoint Online you do get redirected from the Portal to your AD FS Server for credentials. But from that point all looks great in Internet Explorer 10 (?).

Here’s a shot of Word WebApp:

**Lync**

The Lync client is a bit less….. it does not run as a Tile, you have to go to the old Desktop for running Lync….. I guess there will be some sort of remake of Lync Mobile that will fit in to Windows8.

Looking forward to more………
