In my recent blogposts I talked about the upcoming Office365 Exams, both the MCTS and MCITP Certifications and some evaluation on both beta-exams. So, those two exams are the first in the Cloud area of which we see a lot more to come in the coming years…..

Now comes the second one “Microsoft Private Cloud Certification”. For MCITP Enterprise Admins it only takes 2 exams, for MCITP Virtualization Admins only one exam is required. So, what does it look like?

There’s two new exams coming (no dates set yet):

Exam 070-247: Private Cloud Configuration and Deployment with System Center 2012\*

Exam 070-246: Private Cloud Monitoring and Operations with System Center 2012

\*You can skip the 070-247 if you passed 070-659: Windows Server 2008 R2 Server Virtualization

Prerequisite: MCITP Enterprise Admin or the triple MCTS (640,642, 646).

Keep a close eye on this link and be prepared!
