After joining a session on ConfigMgr and Intune, which brought me nothing new, I joined a session on System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2012 R2 ([http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Europe/2013/MDC-B357#fbid=hBjzVKd6xg9](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Europe/2013/MDC-B357) ).

There is some interesting new stuff in SCVMM2012R2:

- Apart from SC AppController for Self-Service there is the Windows Azure Pack. WAP gives the look and feel of Azure but is targeted at your Private Cloud.
- Cisco now provides a Virtual Nexus 1000 Switch ([http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns340/ns517/ns224/ns955/ns963/solution\_overview\_c22-687087.html](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/solutions/collateral/ns340/ns517/ns224/ns955/ns963/solution_overview_c22-687087.html) ) for Virtual Networks based on Hyper-V.
- VMM R2 will provide a Gateway out-of-the-box with the Border Gateway Protocol.
- There will be Service Templates for all System Center Components (sounds like a deeper development of the Powershell Deployment Toolkit)
- Guest Cluster can now use a VHDX as shared storage (as long as the VHDX resides on a CSV Cluster).
- VMM R2 can manage Physical Switches.
- I already mentioned in yesterdays’ Blogpost the Azure Hyper-V Replica Manager for orchestrating a failover to a DR Site.

Pretty neat features for a R2 release!

I’ll be back tomorrow.
