Back in 1996 I entered the IT Space as an “IT Professional”. Before that, I spent 8 years in accounting. IT manifested itself in that area already deeply and I did my fair share. Anyway, I decided I was done with accounting for other people’s money (although I’m good at it).

I started as a Trainer for a non-profit Organization, and I trained some 2,000 persons on the big switch back then from DOS to Windows. I watched some colleagues of mine carrying these MCSE NT4 books around, I thought “wow, that is interesting stuff”. In no time I mastered the Certifications, and I was teaching IT Professionals instead of end users. Those were the Days. Delivering the complete MCSE Tracks on NT4 and Windows 2000 a couple of times.

In retrospect, those were the days indeed. It was all about the marvels of the technology, anything was possible. Then I joined more commercial Organizations and became an Admin, an Engineer, a Consultant, a Senior Consultant and even a Solution Architect over the years. Some 80+ Certifications, another 1,000 Training Participants and 4 Employers later, I now come to the following conclusion:

With all my passion and drive for progress using the latest Technology the way it is supposed to be used, I always engage in conversations with both employers and customers to “move forward”. Of late, I discovered that Senior Consultant or Solution Architect may not be my best way of making people and organizations successful where they want to be successful. I believe the biggest stop on using the latest and greatest Technology is the Knowledge Gap, on all levels in all organizations. My drive is sharing knowledge with those who seek that and who want to benefit from that.

So, I go back to my Roots. Who I am is a Trainer. Out of Passion for making a difference for individuals and organizations. Out of Passion for the Possibilities of modern IT Technologies and its Power to drive Transformation.

Passion, Power and Transformation.

That is who I am and that is what you can count on!
