Kind of a re-iteration from a Blog Post I wrote in March 2019 (remember, pre-COVID19). You can read the Post here [“Training means Train”](https://www.kraak.com/?p=2838)

Now, we are in the middle of that pandemic and I am really, really getting so tired of all the Webinars, Exam preps, Learning videos and the lot of it. Let me quote myself:

*Training is not the same as watching a “how-do-I-….” video on YouTube or attending a Webinar/Seminar. Training means practice, repetition, endurance, discipline, making mistakes, learning to understand why it is as it is. Training is an action; one needs to allocate time for it. Results will take a while. A new insight is not good enough if you do not practice the actions that come out of the new insight. The insight gives a moment of “aha”. After practicing it becomes obvious.*

I never study or learn for an Exam, I only just practice, I train myself. The outcome is that I feel grounded in the matter. And in my line of business that matters! The two most important things here: allocate time and have the discipline. There are no shortcuts and no quick wins.

The point I want to make here, do not overwhelm yourself in attending too many webinars, videos, online learning programs, exam preps, etc. Set yourself some goals, dig in, TRAIN yourself and master the matter at hand.

One more quote: *As a Microsoft Certified Trainer, I tell my students that the Labs are not about getting them done successfully. The Labs are about spending time on the technology, practicing. and learning to understand the why of the technology. The students train!*

That is why I love the Role of being a Microsoft Certified **Trainer**!

Happy Training!
