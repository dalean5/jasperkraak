So, it seems that as of April 4th Microsoft Office 365 Exams will be available; the beta, with corresponding beta-exam numers (071-321 and 071-323) are available NOW until the end of January or until all seats are filled up.  
A true Microsoft track consisting of a Microsoft Certified Technolgy Specilaist series exam:  
Exam 70-321: MCTS Deploying Office 365  
and a Microsot Certified IT Professional series exam:  
Exam 70-323: MCITP Administering Office 365  
The skills being measured can be found at:

That is quit a long list and it’s hard to differentiate between “Deploying” and “Administering” . My guess as an experienced exam taker is that for the first one you need to know which button is where and for het latter one you will need to know when and why you should hit a certain button.

There is no preparation material available just yet, it will be there soon. For now, there is lots of stuff on <http://community.office365.com>and other places on the Internet. And, as a Microsoft Certified Trainer I say: Just do the work! Get yourself some Trial Accounts, set up some labs, buy yourself one or two certificates and domain names and do it.

I delivered a couple of 4 day Ignite-In-A-Box Trainings and practise is really a better way to prepare then reading some whitepapers or abstracts.  
Later this week I will take both exams and I will let you know if the content of “the skills being measured” is accurate. Of course there is a Non-Disclosure-Agreement on Microsoft Exams so don’t you count on me to put up a braindump or extract of the exams up here. You do the work yourself, okay?

Enjoy the work and Good Luck on YOUR Exam(s)!
