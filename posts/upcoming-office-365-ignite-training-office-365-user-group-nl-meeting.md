Next week I will be attending the Office 365 Ignite training in Amsterdam to get all the tech-deep-dives for the vNext of Office 365.

A lot of the attendees at the Ignite training will go to the Office 365 Dutch User Group Meeting on Thursday evening. <http://www.o365ug.nl> if you would like to register.

So watch for my blog posts next week; I have some writing to do ðŸ™‚
