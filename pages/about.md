My passion for Microsoft Technology started in 1996. Since then, I’ve always been a frontrunner in mastering the latest versions of almost the complete product line of Microsoft, resulting in over 80 Certifications.
My Goal as an Advisor, Trainer (MCT), Speaker and Blogger is to transfer Knowledge so Individuals and Organizations optimize the Value out of their IT Investments.

> **“The Value of your IT Investments is only as Big as you Train your Users”**
